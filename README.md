# ohaibot
A Telegram bot with various bits of functionality

Written and tested with Python 3.4.3

## Getting started

This bot is based upon ZombieBot (https://github.com/JochemKuijpers/ZombieBot). Thanks to JochemKuijpers for the great example!

Please note that this bot is meant to run in privacy mode. You can enable privacy mode for your own bot by talking to @BotFather: https://telegram.me/BotFather?setprivacy

If you want to run this code for your own bot, create a second file `config.py` and add your own token:

    token = 'your_token_here'
